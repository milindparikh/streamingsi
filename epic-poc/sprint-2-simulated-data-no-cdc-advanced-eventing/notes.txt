THere are things that in a distributed system that have to be done

     Do "oncely"
         Enable connections from outside for MAIN Node
	 	Elasticsearch
			sudo ufw allow 6300
		Cassandra
			sudo ufw allow 9042
		Kafka
			sudo ufw allow 9092
		zookeeper
			sudo uwf allow 2181
		Flink
			Job Manager
			   sudo ufw allow 6123
			And some other megotiated port in the 3xxxx range


          TASK NODE
	       install sshd -- openssh-server
	       scp authorized keys from MAIN node to TASK node
	       verify passwordless access from MAIN node to TASK node
	       install java
	       set JAVA_HOME in .bashrc
	       download flink
	       expand flink
	       
	       
	       

	Do "repeatedly"
	   Everytime your ips for the cluster changes
		Cassndra -- change listen and rpc address to bind to specific IP
		     example in cassandra.yaml
			 rpc_address: 192.168.56.101
			 listen_address: 192.168.56.101
		ElasticSearch -- change network.host to specific ip daddress
	             example in elasticsearch.yml
		     	 network.host: 192.168.56.101

                Flink Cluster
		      MAIN NODE
		      flink-conf.yaml
		      		     jobmanager.rpc.address: 192.168.56.101
				     slaves
			                  configured task managers
		      TASK NODES
		           copy conf directory from MAIN to TASK
