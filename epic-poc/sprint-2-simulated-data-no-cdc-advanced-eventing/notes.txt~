THere are things that in a distributed system that have to be done

     Do "oncely"
         Enable connections from outside for
	 	Elasticsearch
			sudo ufw allow 6300
		Cassandra
			sudo ufw allow 9042
		Kafka
			sudo ufw allow 9092
		zookeeper
			sudo uwf allow 2181
		Flink
			Job Manager
			   sudo ufw allow 6123
			And some other megotiated port in the 3xxxx range

	Do "repeatedly"
	   Everytime your ips for the cluster changes
		Cassndra -- change listen and rpc address to bind to specific IP
		     example in cassandra.yaml
			 rpc_address: 192.168.43.178
			 listen_address: 192.168.43.178
		ElasticSearch -- change network.host to specific ip daddress
	             example in elasticsearch.yml
		     	 network.host: 192.168.43.178

                Flink Cluster
		     jobmanager.rpc.address: 192.168.43.178
		     


On Flink Cluster
  Flink-Job Manager
    Flink
     Port : 6123
        sudo ufw allow 6123
   ElasticSearch
      Port 6300
   Cassandra
      Port 9042
    Kafka
      port 9092
    Zookeeper
      port 2181
